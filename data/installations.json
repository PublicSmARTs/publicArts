  "description": "When Faith47 arrived in Portland, she brought an image of a drawing of this piece and was able to grid and paint the figure over the course of three days. The female figure is at the core of most of her work. Based in Cape Town, South Africa she began her career as a graphic designer at the age of 19, gradually turning to street art, and now her street art can be found in major cities around the world. The original drawing of this mural was sold to a local collector.",

The seal depicts a wilderness scene including mountains, forest, and the sea with Lady Commerce in the foreground holding a trident in her right hand. Together, these figures symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry. ",

  "description": "The moments captured by these sculptures are quiet and simple and everyday, mirroring the familiar scenes that can occur on a street like Division. Unlike a statue of a hero or icon, whose story is legend, these people are like you, they are mysterious, complicated, and everyone is invited to guess what goes on in their lives. The stones are monuments to these moments—platforms for the characters, whose purpose is to draw attention to them, but the surrounding cityscape is their stage.",

  "description": "James Carpenter was chosen for this project as the result of a rigorous selection process. The sculpture is composed of nearly 500 pieces of specially treated dichroic glass suspended in a 30’ sky dome 70 feet above the floor. Carpenter describes designing the piece as “what appears to be a time-lapse photograph of stars in the sky as they spiral around.” The colors in the dome change with the time of day and one’s viewing angle. In the daytime the sculpture creates ambient light in the rotunda and at night it can be both uplit and backlit to create a reflective surface that both mimics the stars, while also reflecting the activity of the space itself. James Carpenter is an internationally recognized artist who has exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum ",
